# README

This is a plugin that leverages [User344/upl](https://github.com/User344/upl) to help you to **skip the voting stage** of new league honor system(~2024 Sept)

It will try to "click" the skip button down below the screen as soon as possible, so this will be a **Opt-out**, meaning you **don't want vote to anybody**
